What is days on market (DOM) and what can it tell us about our King County market?&nbsp;

Days on market is a statistic that measures how long homes are listed before they sell. The average days on market for homes in King County in May 2018 was 15 days, which is incredibly short. In December 2018, though, that average rose to 33 days, and there are a couple reasons why. &nbsp;

First, we’re at that time of year where the average days on market tends to rise anyway. Second, our market is shifting, which means we’ll be looking at a different real estate environment than the one we saw in 2018. Most economists are predicting a slight recession to take effect later this year and continue into 2020, but that doesn’t mean a crash is imminent, so there’s no need to worry.

We’re already seeing this adjustment take place, but I think we’re in for a strong spring market. I also think we’re moving into more of a neutral market.&nbsp;

If you have any more questions about our market or you plan on buying or selling a home soon in our market, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.
