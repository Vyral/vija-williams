Today I’m excited to talk to you about the importance of pricing a home correctly in this market. Over the last few years, we’ve had an incredible seller’s market, but things are now shifting toward more of a balanced market, which makes pricing all the more important if you plan on selling your home.

When speaking and teaching throughout the nation, one of the things I’m aware of is how different areas have different real estate cultures. The culture here in the Seattle area is that the gap between the sale price and the list price is usually pretty small. **Even when the market is “tanking,” homes typically sell at around 97% of their list price.** We’ve been lucky over the last few years with a ratio of over 100%.

Seattle consumers don’t tend to lowball, so it’s important to price your home where your agent thinks it’s going to sell. **With the average days on market between 30 and 40 days, it’s important that we put your home at a price that will result in it going under contract quickly.**

If you have any questions for me about buying or selling a home in the meantime, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
