As a seller, this winter represents a great time to put your home on the market, and there are three main reasons why.&nbsp;

The first is unique to homes in the Puget Sound area. As much as we think of winter as a seasonally “dark” time, **it actually opens up a lot of scenic views for certain properties.** In fact, we have some properties that have lake views during the winter but not during the spring or summer. If your foliage thins out and gives your home a great view, that’s a great selling point.

Second, **you won’t get as many buyers visiting your home, but the ones who do will be more serious,** which is a win-win for everyone because you won’t have to deal with any of the tire-kickers you see in spring and summer.&nbsp;

Third, **winter is also a great time to buy.** Interest rates are low right now, but they’ll be a full point higher at the end of 2019. It’s also a great time for contingent buyers to buy.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of selling your home this time of year or you’d like to talk more about the benefits of selling now, feel free to call, text, or email me. I’d love to speak to you.
