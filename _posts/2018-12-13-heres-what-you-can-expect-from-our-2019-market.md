What does the crystal ball say about our 2019 market?

Well, first of all, there is no crystal ball that can predict our market, but there are a couple things you need to be aware of moving forward.

For one thing, **our market has shifted, and that’s okay.** We can expect a more neutral market in 2019, which is a change from the strong seller’s market we were in over the past few years. Some areas might even shift into a buyer’s market.

Most economists say that we’re in for a recession near the end of 2019 and into the beginning of 2020, but that doesn’t mean the real estate market is going to crash.

The bottom line is: **A****ll of us in the Seattle area think we have all the makings for a really strong spring**, and it’s an opportune time for many people to buy investment properties or make another purchase they might’ve held off on in previous years.
