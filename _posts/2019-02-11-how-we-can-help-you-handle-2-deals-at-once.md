Many of our clients need to sell their current home in order to buy their next one. We understand how stressful it can be to navigate this scenario, which is why we’d like to offer a few helpful tips today. 

First, **you need to have a team of professionals working on your behalf in order to ensure the deal goes smoothly.** This will mean partnering with an experienced Realtor and a licensed lender before you do anything else. Getting pre-approved at this point is also a great idea.

Once you’ve taken this preliminary step, you’ll need to determine your home’s value. By drawing on data from the recent sales of local, comparable listings, your agent should have no trouble at all in finding an appropriate price range for your home. 

**After you’ve figured out how much your current home is worth and how much you can afford to pay for your next home, it’s time to think about where you want to move.** You should choose an area that offers a convenient commute, is nearby to important amenities, and will be a good match for your lifestyle. 

Finally, your agent should help develop a listing strategy for your property. With the right preparation and the proper professional help, buying and selling simultaneously should be no trouble at all.<br>
